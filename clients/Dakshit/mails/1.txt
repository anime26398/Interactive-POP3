Mam, 

Tomorrow there is a test conducted by J.P.Morgan for internship interview shortlisting from 1pm to 3 pm. So some of the students would be busy during the test. So will it be possible to schedule your class test from 4 pm onwards?

Below I have attached the channeli notice of the same.

Thanking you,
Regards,
Aniruddha
